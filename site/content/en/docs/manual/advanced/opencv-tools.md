The tool based on [Open CV](https://opencv.org/) Computer Vision library
which is an open-source product that includes many CV algorithms.
Some of these algorithms can be used to simplify the annotation process.

First step to work with OpenCV is to load it into CVAT. Click on the toolbar icon, then click `Load OpenCV`.

Once it is loaded, the tool's functionality will be available.

### Intelligent scissors

Intelligent scissors is an CV method of creating a polygon
by placing points with automatic drawing of a line between them.
The distance between the adjacent points is limited by the threshold of action,
displayed as a red square which is tied to the cursor.

- First, select the label and then click on the `intelligent scissors` button.

- Create the first point on the boundary of the allocated object.
  You will see a line repeating the outline of the object.
- Place the second point, so that the previous point is within the restrictive threshold.
  After that a line repeating the object boundary will be automatically created between the points.

  To increase or lower the action threshold, hold `Ctrl` and scroll the mouse wheel.
  Increasing action threshold will affect the performance.
  During the drawing process you can remove the last point by clicking on it with the left mouse button.

- You can also create a boundary manually (like when 
  [creating a polygon](/docs/manual/advanced/annotation-with-polygons/manual-drawing/)) by temporarily disabling 
  the automatic line creation. To do that, switch blocking on by pressing `Ctrl`.

- In the process of drawing, you can select the number of points in the polygon using the switch.

- You can use the `Selected opacity` slider in the `Objects sidebar` to change the opacity of the polygon.
  You can read more in the [Objects sidebar](/docs/manual/basics/objects-sidebar/#appearance) section.

- Once all the points are placed, you can complete the creation of the object
  by clicking on the `Done` button on the top panel or press `N` on your keyboard.
  As a result, a polygon will be created (read more about the polygons in the [annotation with polygons](/docs/manual/advanced/annotation-with-polygons/)).

### Histogram Equalization

Histogram equalization is an CV method that improves contrast in an image in order to stretch out the intensity range.
This method usually increases the global contrast of images when its usable data
is represented by close contrast values.
It is useful in images with backgrounds and foregrounds that are both bright or both dark.

- First, select the image tab and then click on `histogram equalization` button.

- Then contrast of current frame will be improved.
  If you change frame, it will be equalized too.
  You can disable equalization by clicking `histogram equalization` button again.
